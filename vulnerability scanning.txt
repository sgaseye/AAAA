Vulnerability scanning is an integral component of vulnerability management. 
Reporting on vulnerabilities that are detected. The vulnerabilities have to be prioritized in order of business criticality and then added to the remediation queue. 

    Understand how critical a vulnerability is and what would be the impact to the business if exploited
    How easy would it be for a hacker to exploit the vulnerability â€“ does an exploit for it exist and is publicly available
    Are there any existing security controls that could reduce the risk of the vulnerability being exploited.
